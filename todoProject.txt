- machine cleaning 
- making model run slower
- make an agent that is the tubs and then use that to batch the fish into the tubs, so the 'amount of fish*how many boxes / size of tub'


Formula for cleaning
AnyLogic = lognormal(5.14, 0.25, 125.21)

Cutting and filleting
AnyLogic = weibull(1.76, 0.91, 0.15)


Trimming data
AnyLogic = exponential(11.09, 0.45)

Freezing 
AnyLogic = gamma(6.14, 1.77, 2.05)
or
lognormal(3.23,1.81,4.18)
