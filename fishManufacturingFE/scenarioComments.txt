Scenario1
- new gutter is removed for the entire day
- total system time is increased a lot but not the STD. 
- clearly the new gutter is an important resource so buy another perhaps for scenario 2

Scenario2
- old gutter is updated so similar quality as new gutter
- does not make huge difference on time, but does decrease utilisation of both machines

Scenario3
- old gutter is upgraded and new gutter is broken all day
- increase the system time slightly so it needs to have at least two gutters or the one gutter needs more capacity.
- still high variance, which may be due to amount of replications

Scenario4
- automate packing
- doesn't seem to change a thing

Scenario5
- fire an operator so only 4
- increase utilisation to +80 and sytem time, so not good

Scenario6
- nothing good happens
